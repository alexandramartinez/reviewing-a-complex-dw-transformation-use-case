# Reviewing a Complex DataWeave Transformation Use-case

Code demonstrated in the presentation "Reviewing a Complex DataWeave Transformation Use-case" by Alexandra Martinez for the MuleSoft Meetups.

Slides can be found here: https://www.slideshare.net/AlexandraNahomiMartn/reviewing-a-complex-dataweave-transformation-usecase

***Note:*** This is **not** a Mule project. The code was generated using the DataWeave Playground. To learn more about this, please read this article: [How to run locally the DataWeave Playground Docker Image](https://www.prostdev.com/post/how-to-run-locally-the-dataweave-playground-docker-image).

You can copy and paste this transformation code into your own Transform Message component or into the script area for the DW Playground.

Thank you!
